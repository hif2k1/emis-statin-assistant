This is a decision aid protocol to speed up the checking of cholesterol results. 

Essentially try running th eprotocol when you are looking at a cholesterol result. It should quickly summarise for you any action that needs to be taken - patient needs a statin, doesn't need a statin, already on a statin, but not achieved 40% reduction in non-HDL etc. 

Issues 
- Where a patient has been on a statin many years or changed practice whilst on statin or changed statin multiple times this protocol may fail. Usually it will produce the response that the patient is on a statin, but not had a 40% reduction in cholesterol. In this scenario it may be best to check the 40% reduction manually.
- Doesn't currently identify patients with possible familial hypercholesterolaemia.
